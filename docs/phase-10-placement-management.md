# Phase 10 — Placement Drives, Prep Bank, Timed Quizzes & Application Tracker

## 1. Overview & Architecture

Phase 10 introduces the complete **Placement & Career Management Module** for Campus Connect. It bridges the gap between campus recruitment, student preparation, and institutional placement cell operations. The design strictly implements zero-trust server-side validation: all eligibility criteria evaluations, question authoring permissions, answer key hiding, and timed quiz scoring are performed exclusively on the server.

### Primary Workflows

1. **Student Workflow**:
   - **Discover Opportunity**: Browse active placement drives with full-text search, departmental filters, package range, and job role facets.
   - **View Server-Evaluated Eligibility**: Receive a transparent breakdown of eligibility (CGPA threshold, active backlogs limit, allowed departments, allowed semesters, batch graduation year, and required skills) with descriptive failure reasons if ineligible.
   - **Prepare in Placement Bank**: Explore 52+ preparation questions across 14 topical categories (Quantitative Aptitude, DSA, DBMS, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, OOP, HR Interview, etc.) with correct answer keys strictly stripped before submission.
   - **Take Timed Quizzes**: Start an authoritative timed attempt with countdown timer, question palette, question review marking, autosaved answers, grace-period expiration handling, and instant server-side grading with category analytics and explanations.
   - **Apply & Track Application**: Apply to eligible drives, prevent duplicate applications, withdraw if necessary, and observe real-time visual progress across the recruitment funnel (`APPLIED` → `SHORTLISTED` → `ASSESSMENT` → `INTERVIEW` → `SELECTED` / `OFFERED` or `REJECTED` / `WITHDRAWN`).
   - **Placement Readiness Score**: Track a transparent institutional preparation metric computed deterministically from quiz performance (30%), consistency (20%), topic skill coverage (20%), academic eligibility (15%), and application activity (15%).

2. **Placement Officer Workflow**:
   - **Company Management**: Onboard and manage recruiting corporate partners with logo, industry, contact person, website, and company size.
   - **Placement Drive Authoring**: Create drives in `DRAFT` state (concealed from students), configure compensation packages, deadlines, and multi-faceted eligibility criteria.
   - **Publish & Application Window**: Transition drives to `PUBLISHED` to open applications; transition to `APPLICATION_CLOSED` when deadlines expire.
   - **Candidate Pipeline Management**: Review student applications, inspect resumes and cover notes, transition candidate statuses (`APPLIED` → `SHORTLISTED` → `ASSESSMENT` → `INTERVIEW` → `SELECTED` / `OFFERED` / `REJECTED`), and record officer remarks.
   - **Audit Trail**: Every status transition generates an immutable `ApplicationStatusHistory` record, creates an `AuditLog` entry, and dispatches a notification via `NotificationService`.
   - **Institutional Analytics**: Monitor active drives, total applications, shortlist conversion rates, average CTC package, and hiring funnels.

## 2. Database Models & Schema Design

The Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`) incorporates normalized models and enums with safe database-offline fallbacks in `lib/placement/demo-placements.ts`:

### Enums
- `PlacementDriveStatus`: `DRAFT`, `PUBLISHED`, `APPLICATION_CLOSED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED`, `ARCHIVED`
- `EmploymentType`: `FULL_TIME`, `INTERNSHIP`, `INTERNSHIP_TO_FULL_TIME`, `CONTRACT`
- `ApplicationStatus`: `APPLIED`, `SHORTLISTED`, `ASSESSMENT`, `INTERVIEW`, `SELECTED`, `OFFERED`, `REJECTED`, `WITHDRAWN`
- `QuestionDifficulty`: `EASY`, `MEDIUM`, `HARD`
- `QuizStatus`: `DRAFT`, `PUBLISHED`, `ARCHIVED`
- `AttemptStatus`: `IN_PROGRESS`, `SUBMITTED`, `EXPIRED`
- `PrepCategory`: `QUANTITATIVE_APTITUDE`, `LOGICAL_REASONING`, `VERBAL_ABILITY`, `DATA_INTERPRETATION`, `TECHNICAL_MCQ`, `PROGRAMMING`, `DSA`, `DBMS`, `OPERATING_SYSTEMS`, `NETWORKS`, `OOP`, `SYSTEM_DESIGN`, `HR_INTERVIEW`, `TECHNICAL_INTERVIEW`

### Core Models
- **`PlacementCompany`**: Corporate profile (`id`, `name`, `slug`, `logoUrl`, `website`, `industry`, `description`, `location`, `companySize`, `contactPerson`, `contactEmail`, `contactPhone`).
- **`PlacementDrive`**: Recruitment drive entity (`companyId`, `title`, `slug`, `role`, `employmentType`, `location`, `packageMin`, `packageMax`, `currency`, `description`, `applicationDeadline`, `driveDate`, `status`, `minCgpa`, `maxBacklogs`, `allowedDepartments`, `allowedSemesters`, `requiredSkills`, `batchCriteria`, `bondDetails`, `selectionRounds`, `createdBy`).
- **`PlacementApplication`**: Student candidate application (`driveId`, `studentId`, `studentUserId`, `resumeUrl`, `coverNote`, `status`, `officerRemarks`, `appliedAt`, `updatedAt`). Unique constraint prevents duplicate active applications.
- **`ApplicationStatusHistory`**: Lifecycle audit trail (`applicationId`, `oldStatus`, `newStatus`, `changedBy`, `remarks`, `createdAt`).
- **`PrepQuestion`**: Placement preparation question (`category`, `question`, `options`, `correctOptionIndex`, `explanation`, `difficulty`, `topic`, `marks`, `isActive`, `createdBy`). Correct answer and explanations are omitted for student queries prior to attempt completion.
- **`Quiz`**: Timed assessment (`title`, `slug`, `category`, `durationSeconds`, `questionCount`, `totalMarks`, `passingMarks`, `status`, `createdBy`).
- **`QuizQuestion`**: Join table binding questions to quizzes.
- **`QuizAttempt`**: Student exam session (`quizId`, `studentUserId`, `status`, `score`, `percentage`, `passed`, `startedAt`, `submittedAt`, `expiresAt`).
- **`QuizAttemptAnswer`**: Individual answer response (`attemptId`, `questionId`, `selectedOptionIndex`, `isCorrect`, `marksAwarded`).

## 3. Server-Side Engines & Business Logic

### Eligibility Engine (`PlacementService.checkEligibility`)
Evaluates academic and institutional criteria server-side:
- **CGPA Threshold**: Ensures student's CGPA is greater than or equal to `drive.minCgpa`.
- **Backlog Constraint**: Ensures active backlogs count does not exceed `drive.maxBacklogs`.
- **Department Verification**: Validates whether the student's department is in `drive.allowedDepartments` (if specified).
- **Semester Criteria**: Validates whether the student's semester is in `drive.allowedSemesters` (if specified).
- **Batch Criteria**: Compares student graduation year with `drive.batchCriteria`.
- Returns `{ isEligible: boolean, criteria: [{ name, required, actual, passed }], failureReasons: string[] }`.

### Timed Quiz Engine (`QuizService`)
- **Strict Question Projection**: Students querying questions or starting an attempt receive options and prompt ONLY; `correctOptionIndex` and `explanation` are filtered out.
- **Server Timer & Grace Expiration**: `expiresAt` is calculated and enforced on the server. Submissions past the 30-second network grace period are automatically finalized as `EXPIRED`.
- **Server-Side Grading**: Answers are graded by looking up the actual answer keys on the server. Score, percentage, and pass/fail are calculated authoritatively.
- **Review & Explanations**: Only after an attempt status transitions to `SUBMITTED` or `EXPIRED` are detailed question explanations and correct answer keys revealed to the student.

### Placement Readiness Score Formula
A deterministic 0–100 index evaluated across 5 key pillars:
$$\text{Readiness Score} = 0.30 \times Q_{\text{score}} + 0.20 \times Q_{\text{consistency}} + 0.20 \times S_{\text{coverage}} + 0.15 \times A_{\text{eligibility}} + 0.15 \times A_{\text{activity}}$$
- **Quiz Performance ($Q_{\text{score}}$)**: Average percentage across graded quiz attempts.
- **Consistency ($Q_{\text{consistency}}$)**: Metric based on total quizzes attempted (target $\ge 5$).
- **Skill Coverage ($S_{\text{coverage}}$)**: Proportion of preparation categories attempted.
- **Academic Eligibility ($A_{\text{eligibility}}$)**: Institutional profile standing (CGPA, backlogs).
- **Application Activity ($A_{\text{activity}}$)**: Engagement with active placement drives.
- Categorized into tiers: **Elite Candidate** ($\ge 85$), **Placement Ready** ($\ge 70$), **Developing** ($\ge 50$), and **Needs Preparation** ($< 50$).
