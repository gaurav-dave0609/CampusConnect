# Phase 14 — Reports, Analytics & Admin Intelligence

## Executive Summary
Phase 14 transforms Campus Connect from a collection of discrete operational modules into a unified, data-driven academic intelligence platform. By integrating authoritative calculations and records from Phases 1 through 13, Phase 14 provides role-tailored dashboards, deterministic at-risk student detection, classroom & lab utilization tracking, faculty workload capacity audits, cross-departmental benchmarking, and RFC 4180 CSV export functionality with strict zero-trust security and IDOR protection.

The analytics architecture consists of four distinct layers:
1. **Validation & Filter Layer (`validators/analytics.schema.ts`)**: Validates query parameters (`departmentId`, `programId`, `batchId`, `semester`, `divisionId`, `subjectId`, `facultyId`, `dateRange`, `startDate`, `endDate`) and export specifications.
2. **Authoritative Intelligence Engine (`services/analytics.service.ts`)**: Server-side calculation methods that query authoritative data stores without creating redundant or competing formulas.
3. **API & Security Layer (`app/api/analytics/*`)**: 16 REST endpoints that enforce session authentication, role-based authorization, and data-scope isolation.
4. **Presentation & Visualization Layer (`components/analytics/*`)**: Role-specific dashboard views using Recharts for trend analysis, distribution breakdowns, and workload allocations.

## Authoritative Metrics & Calculations

| Metric / Domain | Source Module | Authoritative Formula / Integration Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Attendance Health** | Phase 4 (`AttendanceService`) | $\frac{\text{Present} + \text{Excused}}{\text{Conducted}} \times 100$. Status classification: **SAFE** ($\ge 75\%$), **WARNING** ($65\% - 74.99\%$), **CRITICAL** ($< 65\%$). Partitions Theory vs Practical Lab attendance. |
| **At-Risk Student Registry** | Cross-Module Engine | Deterministic scoring based on: Attendance $< 75\%$, Assignment completion $< 70\%$, Overdue submissions $> 0$, and Placement readiness $< 50\%$. Transparent reason codes provided. |
| **Academic Performance** | Phase 6 & Quiz Engine | Real evaluation scores from graded assignment submissions and timed quizzes. Categorized into standard academic grades: Grade A ($\ge 85\%$), Grade B ($70\% - 84.99\%$), Grade C ($55\% - 69.99\%$), Grade D ($40\% - 54.99\%$), Grade F ($< 40\%$). |
| **Assignment Analytics** | Phase 6 (`AssignmentService`) | Submission rate, On-time rate, Late submission rate, Grading completion rate, Pending grading backlog, and overdue submissions. |
| **Faculty Workload** | Phase 12 (`AcademicService`) | Strictly separates **Assigned Weekly Periods** from **Scheduled Timetable Periods**. Evaluates against maximum weekly capacity ($20$ periods/week) into `OVERLOADED`, `BALANCED`, or `UNDERUTILIZED`. |
| **Timetable & Room Utilization** | Phase 5 & 12 | Classroom utilization rate, Laboratory utilization rate, 6 daily academic period distribution, and available room tracking. |
| **Configuration Health** | Phase 12 (`auditConfigurationHealth`) | Integrated directly into the Executive Overview, reporting `HEALTHY`, `WARNING`, or `CRITICAL` with deep-links to remediation consoles. |
| **Event Analytics** | Phase 8 (`EventService`) | Total events, capacity utilization rate, category distribution (Technical, Cultural, Sports, Workshop, Seminar, Hackathon, Placement), and conversion. |
| **Club Analytics** | Phase 9 (`ClubService`) | Reuses the deterministic Club Engagement Score ($0 - 100$) and Tier Index (`ELITE`, `ACTIVE`, `DEVELOPING`, `PROBATIONARY`). |
| **Placement Analytics** | Phase 10 (`PlacementService`) | Recruitment funnel (`APPLIED`, `SHORTLISTED`, `INTERVIEW_SCHEDULED`, `SELECTED`, `REJECTED`), Readiness score distribution, and quiz attempt performance. |
| **Lost & Found Analytics** | Phase 11 (`LostFoundService`) | Resolution rate and category distribution without exposing private claimant verification answers. |
| **Notification Analytics** | Phase 13 (`NotificationService`) | Delivery volume, read rate, category distribution, and audience reach. |

## CSV Export Engine
The export engine generates standard RFC 4180 compliant CSV files with appropriate `Content-Type: text/csv` and `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="report-*.csv"` headers.
Supported report types:
- `attendance`: Student ID, Roll Number, Name, Department, Conducted, Present, Absent, Percentage, Risk Status.
- `assignments`: ID, Title, Subject, Total Submissions, Submission Rate, On-Time Rate, Average Marks, Status.
- `faculty-workload`: Faculty ID, Name, Department, Assigned Weekly Hours, Scheduled Weekly Hours, Theory, Lab, Max Capacity, Status.
- `placement`: Drive ID, Company, Role, Batch, Minimum CGPA, Max Backlogs, Applications, Selected, Status.
