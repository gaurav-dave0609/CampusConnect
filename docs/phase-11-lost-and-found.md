# Phase 11 — Lost & Found Community Board & Claim Verification

## Overview

The **Campus Connect Lost & Found System** provides an institutional, zero-trust community board and recovery ecosystem tailored for modern college campuses. Built entirely on Next.js 16 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, and PostgreSQL, this module replaces disorganized messaging groups with a structured, verified lifecycle:

$$\text{Report (Lost/Found)} \longrightarrow \text{Publish/Draft} \longrightarrow \text{Deterministic Potential Match} \longrightarrow \text{Evidence-Backed Claim} \longrightarrow \text{Admin Verification} \longrightarrow \text{Physical Handover} \longrightarrow \text{Read-Only Resolved}$$

## 1. Architecture & Core Workflow

The system provides separate, secure workflows for students, moderators/administrators, and physical campus recovery desks:

    subgraph Discovery ["1. Item Reporting & Discovery"]
        A[Reporter Submits Item] -->|Draft| B[Private Draft State]
        B -->|Author Publishes| C[Public Community Feed]
        A -->|Publish Immediately| C
        C --> D[Deterministic Matching Engine]
        D -->|Identifies Candidate Counterparts| E[Transparent Match Score 0-100%]
    end

    subgraph Verification ["2. Recovery & Verification Workflow"]

        F -->|Provide Private Proof| G[Claim Status: PENDING]

        I -->|Insufficient Proof| J[Claim Status: REJECTED]
        I -->|Proof Confirmed| K[Claim Status: VERIFIED]
    end

    subgraph Handover ["3. Handover & Resolution"]
        K --> L[Item Status: VERIFICATION]
        L -->|Physical ID Verification| M[Record Handover]
        M --> N[Claim Status: COMPLETED]
        N --> O[Item Status: RESOLVED]
        O --> P[Permanent Read-Only Lock]
    end
```

## 2. Database Models & Schema Extensions

Upgraded normalized models in `prisma/schema.prisma`:

### `LostFoundItem`
- **`id`**: Unique primary key UUID.
- **`referenceNumber`**: Deterministic unique public case identifier formatted as `LF-YYYY-XXXX`.
- **`type`**: Enum `LostFoundType` (`LOST` | `FOUND`).
- **`title`**: String (3–100 characters).
- **`category`**: Enum `LostFoundCategory` (14 categories: `ELECTRONICS`, `ID_DOCUMENT`, `STUDENT_CARD`, `BOOK`, `BAG`, `CLOTHING`, `KEYS`, `JEWELLERY`, `ACCESSORY`, `STATIONERY`, `SPORTS`, `WALLET`, `WATER_BOTTLE`, `OTHER`).
- **`description`**: String (10–2000 characters).
- **`status`**: Enum `LostFoundStatus` (`DRAFT`, `PUBLISHED`, `CLAIM_PENDING`, `VERIFICATION`, `RESOLVED`, `CLOSED`, `EXPIRED`, `ARCHIVED`, `REJECTED`).
- **`location`**: String representing campus building/zone (e.g. "Central Library Reading Hall", "Main Auditorium Lobby").
- **`dateLostFound`**: Date string when item was misplaced/discovered.
- **`timeLostFound`**: Optional approximate time.
- **`contactPreference`**: Default `CAMPUS_PORTAL` preventing leak of phone numbers/emails.
- **`identifyingDetails`**: Non-public identifying marks (e.g., engravings, secret pocket items, serial snippets) used by reviewers.
- **`imageUrl`**: Secure validated image path.
- **`reporterId`**: Foreign key to `User`.
- **`resolvedAt`**, **`resolvedBy`**, **`resolutionNotes`**: Audit metadata populated upon case closure.

### `LostFoundClaim`
- **`id`**: Unique claim UUID.
- **`itemId`**: Foreign key to `LostFoundItem`.
- **`claimantId`**: Foreign key to `User`.
- **`claimStatement`**: Formal recovery statement describing how/when item was lost.
- **`verificationAnswers`**: Secret proof-of-ownership details submitted privately by the claimant.
- **`status`**: Enum `ClaimStatus` (`PENDING`, `UNDER_REVIEW`, `VERIFIED`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, `WITHDRAWN`, `COMPLETED`).
- **`submittedAt`**, **`reviewedAt`**, **`reviewedBy`**, **`reviewerRemarks`**, **`resolvedAt`**: Full review audit trail.
- **Constraint**: `@@unique([itemId, claimantId])` strictly preventing duplicate active claims on the same case.

### `LostFoundAttachment`
- Normalized reference storing `fileUrl`, `fileName`, `fileSize`, and `mimeType` with path traversal sanitization.

### `LostFoundMatch`
- Caches deterministic potential counterpart matching relations (`lostItemId`, `foundItemId`, `matchScore`, `matchingFactors`, `status`).

## 3. Potential Matching Engine

The matching engine (`LostFoundService.findMatchesForItem`) implements a multi-factor deterministic scoring algorithm that evaluates counter-type items (LOST $\leftrightarrow$ FOUND) on a 0–100 scale:

| Factor | Weight | Scoring Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Category Match** | **30%** | Exact match on `LostFoundCategory` enum (e.g., both `WATER_BOTTLE`). |
| **Keyword Similarity** | **20%** | Tokenized title, description, and characteristics filtered against campus stopwords. |
| **Location Proximity** | **20%** | Tokenized overlap of campus buildings/zones (e.g. "Library", "Canteen"). |
| **Date Proximity** | **15%** | $\le 1$ day: 15 pts; $\le 3$ days: 10 pts; $\le 7$ days: 5 pts. |
| **Color & Brand Keywords** | **15%** | Cross-matched distinctive brands/colors (e.g. "Hydro Flask", "Blue", "Sony"). |

### Deterministic Integrity & Anti-False-Positive Rules
1. **No Automatic Ownership**: Matches are explicitly branded as **Potential Matches** with confidence scores and reasoning checklists (e.g., "✓ Identical category", "✓ Location proximity"). The engine **never** auto-approves or transfers ownership.
2. **Opposite-Type Only**: LOST items are only matched against FOUND items and vice-versa.
3. **Active State Only**: Drafts, archived, rejected, and resolved items are strictly excluded from candidate matching.

## 4. Claim Verification & Anti-Fraud Architecture

1. **Information Asymmetry**: Distinguishing details (such as serial snippets, inner wallet contents, or private engravings) are hidden from public item feeds. Claimants must independently declare these in their `verificationAnswers`.
2. **Self-Approval Prohibition**: Server-side RBAC strictly blocks students from reviewing or approving their own claims (`403 Forbidden`). Only authorized campus administrators (`Role.ADMIN`) can review verification proofs.
3. **Anti-Self-Claim**: A student cannot submit a claim on an item they themselves reported.
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: The system enforces unique active claims per item-claimant pair (`409 Conflict`).
5. **Private Access Control**: Unrelated students cannot view private claim verification details submitted by other students.
6. **Read-Only Lockdown**: Once an item is marked `RESOLVED`, all subsequent claims and modifications are permanently rejected.

## 5. File & Image Security

Uploaded attachments (`/api/lost-found/upload`) pass strict server-side validation (`LostFoundService.validateUploadedAttachment`):
- **Whitelisted Extensions**: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`.
- **Blocked Executables & Scripts**: `.exe`, `.bat`, `.sh`, `.cmd`, `.js`, `.vbs`, `.php`, `.py`, `.bin`, `.msi`.
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Rejection of filenames containing `..`, `/`, `\`.
- **Max File Size**: 5MB hard limit enforced before disk persistence.
- **Sanitized Filenames**: Alphanumeric timestamped naming ensuring no internal filesystem paths are exposed to the client.
