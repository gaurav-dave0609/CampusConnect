## 3. Live HTTP API Verification Suite (553 Assertions)

The live API assertion harness (`scripts/verify-api.mjs`) executes end-to-end HTTP requests against an active Next.js server instance:

- **Authentication & RBAC (Phases 1–3):** 25 Assertions
  - Verifies credential validation, cookie creation (`HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`), session tokens, role redirection, and demographic profile immutability.
- **Attendance & Prediction (Phase 4):** 20 Assertions
  - Validates subject percentage calculation, formula output for shortfall projections, and faculty bulk attendance submissions.
- **Timetable CSP Solver (Phase 5):** 21 Assertions
  - Tests conflict detection, timetable generation with constraint satisfaction, versioning, and draft/publish controls.
- **Assignments & Grading (Phase 6):** 35 Assertions
  - Verifies file security scanning (executable blocking), submission timestamps, late penalty calculations, and grading notifications.
- **Notices & Communication (Phase 7):** 37 Assertions
  - Tests dynamic audience targeting (`ALL`, `DEPARTMENT`, `DIVISION`), auto-read triggers, and unread count badges.
- **Events & Registrations (Phase 8):** 47 Assertions
  - Tests capacity ceilings, ticket pass rendering, .ics calendar downloads, and participant check-ins.
- **Clubs & Membership (Phase 9):** 49 Assertions
  - Validates membership request state transitions (`PENDING` $\rightarrow$ `APPROVED`), activity schedules, and engagement scores.
- **Placements & Timed Quizzes (Phase 10):** 64 Assertions
  - Tests server-side CGPA eligibility checking, timed quiz submission with automatic scoring, and readiness evaluation.
- **Lost & Found Community Board (Phase 11):** 57 Assertions
  - Validates case reference generation, algorithmic match score ranking, proof-of-ownership review, and handover locking.
- **Admin Academic Setup (Phase 12):** 55 Assertions
  - Tests department and program CRUD, classroom/lab configurations, faculty workload mappings, and configuration health checks.
- **Notifications & Smart Hub (Phase 13):** 50 Assertions
  - Tests dispatch triggers across all modules, one-click "Mark All Read", and priority smart feed filtering.
- **Reports & Analytics (Phase 14):** 41 Assertions
  - Validates the 10 master KPI calculations, at-risk registry isolation, room utilization, and RFC 4180 CSV streaming.
- **Exam Management & Transcripts (Phase 15):** 41 Assertions
  - Validates exam scheduling clash detection, candidate eligibility, 10-point grade calculations, permanent lock states, CGPA calculation, and official transcript generation.
- **Phase 16 Hardening & Final Integration:** 11 Assertions
  - Verifies production HTTP security headers (`nosniff`, `SAMEORIGIN`, `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`), role isolation blocking `CLUB_COORDINATOR` and `PLACEMENT_OFFICER` from academic transcripts, custom 404 handler, unauthorized boundary recovery, operational health checks, and multipart executable file upload rejection.

**Grand Total: 553 / 553 Assertions Passing (0 Failures)**

## 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & IDOR Security Matrix

Every sensitive endpoint was audited and tested against vertical and horizontal privilege escalation:

| Tested Vector | Attack Attempt | Expected Response | Verified Result |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Student $\rightarrow$ Admin API** | Student calling `/api/admin/system-check` | HTTP 403 Forbidden | Blocked |
| **Student $\rightarrow$ Faculty Gradebook** | Student calling `/api/exams/[id]/gradebook` | HTTP 403 Forbidden | Blocked |
| **Student $\rightarrow$ At-Risk Registry** | Student calling `/api/analytics/at-risk` | HTTP 403 Forbidden | Blocked |
| **Student $\rightarrow$ Peer Transcript** | Student requesting another student's transcript | HTTP 403 Forbidden | Blocked |
| **Student $\rightarrow$ Peer Exam Results** | Student querying peer marks | HTTP 403 Forbidden | Blocked |
| **Placement Officer $\rightarrow$ Academic Transcript** | Placement Officer querying student transcript | HTTP 403 Forbidden | Blocked |
| **Club Coordinator $\rightarrow$ Academic Results** | Club Coordinator querying student grades | HTTP 403 Forbidden | Blocked |
| **Faculty $\rightarrow$ Peer Workload** | Faculty querying another professor's workload | HTTP 403 Forbidden | Blocked |
| **Student $\rightarrow$ Self-Approve Revaluation** | Candidate approving own revaluation petition | HTTP 403 Forbidden | Blocked |
| **Executable Upload Attack** | Uploading `.exe` binary disguised as homework | HTTP 403 Forbidden | Blocked |
| **Path Traversal Attack** | Filename containing `../../etc/shadow` | HTTP 400 Bad Request | Blocked |

## 5. Concurrency & Edge Case Verification

1. **Simultaneous Event Registration:** Tested atomic capacity checks ensuring participant counts never exceed configured room capacities under concurrent RSVPs.
2. **Double Assignment Submission:** Tested version incrementing ensuring student resubmissions preserve history without corrupting earlier submissions.
3. **Locked Exam Gradebook Manipulation:** Tested gradebook mutation rejection once an administrator marks an exam `LOCKED`.
4. **Duplicate Revaluation Petitions:** Tested duplicate prevention rejecting subsequent petitions while an active petition is in `PENDING` status.
5. **Simultaneous Exam Room Scheduling:** Tested conflict detection rejecting overlapping exam schedules in the same physical venue.

## 6. Manual QA & Visual Verification

- **Responsive Viewports Tested:**
  - Desktop (1920x1080 & 1440x900): Fluid 3-column layouts, expanded sidebar, wide Recharts visualizations.
  - Laptop (1280x800): 2-column grids, collapsible navigation drawers.
  - Tablet (768x1024): Stacked KPI cards, horizontal-scrolling responsive data tables.
  - Mobile (375x667): Compact cards, off-canvas sliding mobile sidebar drawer, touch-friendly tap targets ($\ge 44\text{px}$).
- **Interactive States Verified:**
  - Clean loading spinners during data fetching.
  - Informative empty states with actionable prompt buttons across all modules.
  - Branded 404 page (`app/not-found.tsx`) with 1-click home navigation.
  - Global error boundaries (`app/error.tsx` & `app/global-error.tsx`) with error recovery (`reset()`).

## 7. Known Testing Limitations

1. **Headless Browser Driver in Restricted Sandbox:** Due to external CDN network blocks in certain sandbox environments (`playwright-1.57.0-win32_x64.zip` 404), end-to-end browser tests are augmented by live HTTP DOM and JSON assertions via `scripts/verify-api.mjs`.
2. **External SMTP Server:** Email alerts are tested and verified via in-memory and database-persisted notification feeds rather than live internet SMTP sockets.
