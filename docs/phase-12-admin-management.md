# Phase 12 — Admin Management: Academic Setup, Faculty Mapping, Rooms & Laboratories

## Overview

Phase 12 delivers the authoritative Academic Setup, Infrastructure, and Resource Management foundation for **Campus Connect — All-in-One College Ecosystem**. It establishes a centralized, zero-trust administrative control plane for institutions to define:

1. **Academic Hierarchy**: Departments, Programs/Courses, Batches, Academic Semesters, Classes, and Divisions.
2. **Curricular Setup**: Theory, Laboratory, and Elective Subjects with credit units, weekly teaching frequencies, and lab constraints.
3. **Faculty Resource Allocation**: Subject and Division mappings with deterministic teaching workload calculations.
4. **Physical & Specialized Infrastructure**: Physical Classrooms, Seminar Halls, Auditoriums, and specialized Laboratories with equipment inventory and capacity constraints.
5. **Deterministic Timetable Integration**: Authoritative prerequisite validation for the Phase 5 CSP timetable generator.
6. **Configuration Health Engine**: System-wide automated diagnostics classifying academic setups into `HEALTHY`, `WARNING`, and `CRITICAL` states with actionable remediation guidance.

## 1. Academic Hierarchy & Data Modeling

The academic hierarchy operates in a strict, parent-to-child relationship structure:

```
Department (e.g. Computer Science & Engineering)
  └── Program / Course (e.g. B.Tech Computer Engineering - 4 Years, 8 Sems)
      └── Batch (e.g. Batch 2026: 2022–2026)
          └── Academic Semester (e.g. Semester 6 / 2024-2025 Even)
              └── Class (e.g. Third Year B.Tech CSE - Sem 6)
                  └── Division (e.g. CE-A, CE-B - Capacity: 60)
                      └── Subjects & Faculty Assignments
```

### Prisma Schema Extensions

The existing database schema in `prisma/schema.prisma` was extended additively with zero breaking changes or destructive cascading deletes:

- **`Department`**: Added `isActive: Boolean` and `headOfDepartment: String?`.
- **`Program`**: New model representing degree programs (`code`, `degree`, `durationYears`, `totalSemesters`, `departmentId`, `isActive`).
- **`Batch`**: New model representing student intake cohorts (`name`, `startYear`, `endYear`, `programId`, `currentSemester`, `isActive`).
- **`AcademicSemester`**: New model representing academic terms (`semesterNumber`, `academicYear`, `term`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `isActive`).
- **`Class`**: Extended with `programId`, `batchId`, and `isActive`.
- **`Division`**: Extended with `code`, `capacity`, and `isActive`.
- **`Subject`**: Extended with `description`, `syllabusUrl`, `programId`, `laboratoryId`, `requiresLab`, and `isActive`.
- **`FacultySubject`**: Extended with `weeklyHours` and `isActive`.
- **`Room`**: Extended with `departmentId` and `isActive`.
- **`Laboratory`**: New model representing dedicated scientific and computing labs (`code`, `departmentId`, `roomId`, `capacity`, `equipment`, `labAssistant`, `isActive`).

## 2. Server-Side Security & RBAC Enforcement

All administrative mutations and sensitive endpoints are strictly guarded on the server side:

- **Zero-Trust Role Check**: Enforced via `checkRole([Role.ADMIN])` and `requireRole([Role.ADMIN])`.
- **Student & Faculty Blocking**: Any attempt by `STUDENT`, `FACULTY`, or unauthorized roles to mutate departments, programs, classes, divisions, subjects, mappings, rooms, or laboratories yields an immediate `403 Forbidden` response.
- **Auditing**: Every create, update, deactivate, map, or unmap operation records an `AuditLog` entry detailing the acting administrator, action type, entity, and metadata payload.

---

## 3. Workload Calculation & Resource Validation

### Deterministic Faculty Workload Engine
The `AcademicService.calculateFacultyWorkload()` utility computes:
- **Total Assigned Subjects & Divisions**: Aggregated across all active mappings.
- **Weekly Theory vs. Lab Periods**: Distinguishing 1-hour lecture blocks from 2-hour continuous laboratory sessions.
- **Assigned vs. Scheduled Teaching Workload**: Authoritatively cross-checked against timetable slot allocations.
- **Maximum Workload Warnings**: Alerts administrators if any faculty member exceeds institutional weekly teaching caps (e.g. >20 hours/week).

### Timetable Solver Integration (`validateTimetablePrerequisites`)
Before generating timetables via the Phase 5 engine, Phase 12 validates:
1. Every active division has active subjects assigned.
2. Every active subject is mapped to at least one designated faculty member.
3. Every lab subject (`requiresLab = true` or `type = LAB`) is linked to a valid, active laboratory with compatible equipment and room capacity.
4. Physical classrooms and laboratories are active and available.
