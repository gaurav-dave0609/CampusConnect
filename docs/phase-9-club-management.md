# Phase 9: Club Management, Membership & Coordinator Workflows

## 1. Executive Summary & Overview
Phase 9 delivers a comprehensive, production-grade **Club Management, Membership & Coordinator System** for Campus Connect. It serves as the institutional community and co-curricular backbone, connecting students, faculty mentors, club coordinators, and academic administrators.

The primary workflow supported is:
$$\text{Discover Clubs} \longrightarrow \text{View Club Detail} \longrightarrow \text{Join Club} \longrightarrow \text{Coordinator Review} \longrightarrow \text{Manage Members} \longrightarrow \text{Host Activities} \longrightarrow \text{Link Phase 8 Events} \longrightarrow \text{Track Deterministic Engagement}$$

All operations adhere to zero-trust server-side RBAC, transactional integrity, unified notification triggers, and seamless cross-module links to Phase 7 Notices, Phase 8 Events, Profile, and AuditLog systems.

## 2. Database Design & Relational Models

### 2.1 Prisma Schema Integration
The schema incorporates extended enums and three normalized models within PostgreSQL:

```prisma
enum ClubCategory {
  TECHNICAL
  CULTURAL
  SPORTS
  LITERARY
  SOCIAL
  ENTREPRENEURSHIP
  DESIGN
  ROBOTICS
  CODING
  OTHER
}

enum ClubStatus {
  DRAFT
  PUBLISHED
  ACTIVE
  SUSPENDED
  ARCHIVED
}

enum MembershipRole {
  MEMBER
  COORDINATOR
  FACULTY_ADVISOR
}

enum MembershipStatus {
  PENDING
  ACTIVE
  APPROVED
  REJECTED
  LEFT
}

enum ClubActivityType {
  MEETING
  WORKSHOP
  PRACTICE
  TRAINING
  COMPETITION_PREP
  COMMUNITY_SERVICE
  OTHER
}
```

### 2.2 Models
1. **Club (`Club`)**:
   - `id`: Unique identifier (`club-001`, `cuid`).
   - `name`, `slug`: Unique slug for URL routing.
   - `description`, `shortDescription`: Formatted markdown and preview briefs.
   - `category`: `ClubCategory` enum.
   - `departmentId`, `department`: Optional departmental affiliation.
   - `facultyAdvisorId`, `coordinatorId`: Foreign keys to User records.
   - `logoUrl`, `bannerUrl`: Unsplash curated photographic graphics.
   - `contactEmail`, `contactPhone`: Official public inquiries.
   - `status`: `ClubStatus` (`DRAFT`, `PUBLISHED`, `ACTIVE`, `SUSPENDED`, `ARCHIVED`).
   - `establishedYear`, `isRecruiting`: Institutional metadata.
   - Relations: `memberships` (`ClubMembership[]`), `activities` (`ClubActivity[]`), `events` (`Event[]`).

2. **ClubMembership (`ClubMembership`)**:
   - `id`: Unique membership record ID.
   - `clubId`: Relation to `Club`.
   - `userId`: Relation to `User` (student/faculty).
   - `role`: `MembershipRole` (`MEMBER`, `COORDINATOR`, `FACULTY_ADVISOR`).
   - `status`: `MembershipStatus` (`PENDING`, `ACTIVE`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, `LEFT`).
   - `appliedAt`, `joinedAt`, `approvedAt`, `approvedBy`, `leftAt`: Exact auditing timestamps.
   - Constraint: `@@unique([clubId, userId])` strictly preventing duplicate applications or phantom records.

3. **ClubActivity (`ClubActivity`)**:
   - `id`: Activity identifier.
   - `clubId`: Parent club.
   - `title`, `description`: Scope of activity.
   - `activityDate`: Scheduled UTC datetime.

```

1. **`DRAFT`**:
   - Visible only to `ADMIN`.
   - Hidden from student discovery `/api/clubs` and direct route access returns `404 Not Found`.
2. **`PUBLISHED` / `ACTIVE`**:
   - Discoverable by all students and faculty.
   - Accepts new membership applications and activity scheduling.
3. **`SUSPENDED`**:
   - Flagged by institutional admin.
   - Rejects all incoming membership requests with `400 Bad Request`.
   - Halts activity scheduling and public event hosting.
4. **`ARCHIVED`**:
   - Read-only historical preservation.
   - Roster changes and new postings prohibited.

## 5. Event & Notice Integrations

### 5.1 Reusing Phase 8 Events Architecture
Club public events (competitions, symposiums, hackathons) **do not duplicate event schemas**. Instead:
- Events in `EventService` and `EventStore` support `organizerRole: CLUB_COORDINATOR` and `clubId: string`.
- When fetching club details (`ClubService.getClubById`), the service queries the unified Event store (`eventStore.find({ clubId })`), appending upcoming registrations, capacities, dates, and live status.
- Clicking on any event card on `/dashboard/student/clubs/[id]` immediately navigates to `/dashboard/student/events/[id]`, honoring registration limits, waitlists, and QR tickets.

### 5.2 Notice Integration
- Departmental and club-level broadcasts leverage `NoticeService` with targeted audience criteria (`targetAudience: "CLUB_MEMBERS"` or specific role tags).

---

## 6. Deterministic Engagement Score Formula

Campus Connect strictly avoids opaque or fabricated "AI" scores. Club engagement is evaluated deterministically based on empirical participation telemetry:

$$\text{Score} = \min\left(100, \;\; \lfloor w_m \cdot S_{\text{members}} + w_e \cdot S_{\text{events}} + w_r \cdot S_{\text{registrations}} + w_a \cdot S_{\text{activities}} \rfloor\right)$$

Where:
- $S_{\text{members}} = \min(100, \; \text{Total Members} \times 4)$ (Weight $w_m = 0.25$)
- $S_{\text{events}} = \min(100, \; \text{Upcoming Events} \times 25)$ (Weight $w_e = 0.25$)
- $S_{\text{registrations}} = \min(100, \; \text{Cumulative Event Registrations} \times 2)$ (Weight $w_r = 0.25$)
- $S_{\text{activities}} = \min(100, \; \text{Scheduled Activities} \times 15)$ (Weight $w_a = 0.25$)

This metric is transparent, auditable, and directly incentivizes active student leadership and event hosting.
