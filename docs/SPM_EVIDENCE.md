- **Total Development Phases:** 16 Phases (Foundation, RBAC, Profiles, Attendance, Timetable CSP, Assignments, Notices, Events, Clubs, Placements, Lost & Found, Admin Setup, Notifications, Analytics, Exams & Gradebook, Final Integration & Security)
- **Cumulative Test Coverage:** 446 automated tests across 19 test suites; 553 live HTTP API verification assertions
- **Final Build Status:** Production build PASS with 235+ static and dynamic routes

## 3. Development Workflow

The project followed an agile, iterative phase-based delivery model:
1. **Requirements & Constraint Analysis:** Defining functional specifications, boundary constraints, and threat models for each module.
2. **Data Modeling & Migration:** Designing normalized Prisma schemas, establishing foreign key relations, and indexing query paths.
3. **Domain Service Implementation:** Implementing core business logic with defensive validation, idempotency, and server-side authorization.
4. **API Route Handlers:** Authoring RESTful App Router handlers (`/api/*`) with strict input parsing (Zod) and HTTP error semantics.
5. **UI & Dashboard Construction:** Creating responsive, accessible interfaces adhering to design tokens with loading, error, and empty states.
6. **Regression & Live HTTP Testing:** Writing dedicated Vitest unit/integration tests followed by live HTTP verification against a running server.

---

## 4. Task Management

The project utilized milestone-driven phase execution:
- **Phase Breakdown:** 16 distinct functional milestones tracked via `PROJECT_STATUS.md`.
- **Status Reporting:** Quantitative metrics recorded after every phase (test counts, HTTP assertions, route counts).

## 5. Communication Workflow

Team communication protocols were established around daily asynchronous standups and milestone reviews:
- **Architecture Syncs:** Aligning on schema adjustments and API contracts before implementation.
- **Merge & Test Reviews:** Verifying that no phase introduced regressions into preceding phases.

## 6. Research & Reference Workflow

Key algorithmic and engineering references utilized:
- **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP):** Russell & Norvig, *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* (MRV and Forward Checking heuristics implemented in Timetable solver).
- **Academic Grading Systems:** UGC / AICTE 10-point relative and absolute grading scale guidelines.
- **Attendance Policy Models:** AICTE mandatory 75% minimum attendance requirement with mathematical shortfall projections.
- **Web Application Security:** OWASP Top 10 guidelines (Zero-trust RBAC, IDOR mitigation, input validation, executable upload blocking).

> **Research Notebooks / Literature Reviews:**  
> `EVIDENCE REQUIRED`  
> *(Attach NotebookLM summaries, IEEE reference papers, or literature review document links here).*

## 7. AI Tool Usage & Attribution

Generative AI (Antigravity IDE powered by Google DeepMind models) was utilized as an agentic pair programmer under strict human supervision:
- **AI Domain of Assistance:** Scaffolding boilerplate route handlers, generating test fixtures, optimizing TypeScript type unions, and drafting baseline documentation.
- **Human Governance:** All architectural decisions, security boundaries, grading formulas, and acceptance criteria were established, inspected, and validated by the human engineering team.
- **Detailed Log:** Refer to [docs/AI_USAGE.md](file:///D:/CampusConnect/docs/AI_USAGE.md) for full disclosure and governance records.

## 8. Git / GitHub Workflow

The repository was managed using standard Git branching and feature-commit conventions:
- **Branching Strategy:** Mainline trunk development with phase-specific feature branches merged upon full test verification.
- **Commit Format:** Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`).
- **Recent Repository Commits:**
  - `ed57c4f` — *feat: add exam management gradebook and academic transcripts* (Phase 15 completion)
  - Preceding commits covering Phases 1 through 14.
  - Final Phase 16 Commit — *feat: finalize Campus Connect for production deployment*.

## 9. Testing & Quality Assurance Workflow

Campus Connect implemented a zero-regression, multi-layer testing protocol:

```
                  ┌──────────────────────────────┐
                  │    Production Smoke Tests    │
                  │   Auth / Dashboards / 404    │
                  ├──────────────────────────────┤
                  │   Live HTTP Verification     │
                  │ 553 Assertions via Script    │
                  ├──────────────────────────────┤
                  │    Vitest Automated Suite    │
                  │ 446 Unit & Integration Tests │
                  ├──────────────────────────────┤
                  │ TypeScript Strict Type-Check │
                  │     0 Errors (tsc --noEmit)   │
                  └──────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Regression Policy:** After completing each phase, the *entire* cumulative test suite was re-executed. Zero test degradation was tolerated.

## 10. Deployment Workflow

- **Target Platform:** Vercel (Optimized for Next.js App Router).
- **Database Engine:** Managed PostgreSQL (Neon / Supabase / Vercel Postgres).
- **Build Pipeline:** `npm run build` runs `prisma generate`, TypeScript type verification, and static page prerendering.
- **Runtime Environment:** Node.js 18.x/20.x with Edge Runtime middleware.

## 15. Known Limitations & Academic Disclaimers

1. **Production Mail Server:** Outbound emails currently log through the internal notification hub; live transactional email requires university SMTP gateway credentials.
2. **Database Provisioning:** For offline examination lab demonstrations, the application incorporates resilient in-memory fallback stores to demonstrate 100% of workflows without requiring an active PostgreSQL service.
