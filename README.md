# Campus Connect — All-in-One College Ecosystem

> A production-grade, multi-role academic enterprise resource planning (ERP) and campus life management platform engineered with Next.js 16 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma ORM, and PostgreSQL.

---

## Overview

**Campus Connect** is a centralized college ecosystem designed to unify the academic, administrative, and student life activities of higher education institutions. Rather than relying on fragmented third-party tools, legacy desktop systems, and disconnected spreadsheets, Campus Connect delivers an integrated, real-time platform covering curriculum scheduling, daily attendance, continuous grading, semester examinations, corporate placements, club governance, lost-and-found recoveries, and executive intelligence.

---

## Problem Statement

Higher education institutions face significant operational and data silos:
1. **Academic Fragmentation:** Timetable generation, daily attendance marking, and assignment submissions are conducted across disparate legacy tools.
2. **Attendance Vulnerability & Late Interventions:** Manual registers delay identification of at-risk students until exam eligibility deadlines have already passed.
3. **Examination & Transcript Inefficiencies:** Gradebook tabulation, moderation, revaluation petitions, and transcript printing suffer from slow processing times and calculation discrepancies.
4. **Campus Life Disconnection:** Campus drives, club memberships, campus notices, and lost item recovery operate on informal social groups lacking verification or auditability.
5. **Lack of Institutional Visibility:** Department heads and deans lack real-time predictive analytics to forecast pass rates, monitor room utilization, and benchmark department workloads.

Campus Connect resolves these challenges through a unified data model, deterministic algorithms (constraint satisfaction, multi-factor matching, weighted readiness scoring), and strict role-based access control.

---

## Key Features

- **Multi-Role RBAC:** Discrete access permissions for Student, Faculty, Admin, Club Coordinator, and Placement Officer.
- **Constraint-Based Timetable Generator:** Deterministic CSP engine solving room, faculty, and division conflicts with MRV heuristics and forward checking.
- **Predictive Attendance Engine:** Real-time attendance percentage tracking with "classes required to attain 75%" projection formula.
- **Assignment Lifecycle & File Security:** Late penalties, versioned resubmissions, grading drawers, and strict executable file blocking.
- **Institutional Communication & Dynamic Targeting:** Targeted notices by department, division, or role with live preview, read tracking, and unread badges.
- **Event Discovery & Atomic Capacity Management:** State-driven events, race-condition safe RSVPs, QR/Confirmation passes, and .ics calendar exports.
- **Club Governance:** Discoverable student organizations, application pipelines, event hosting, and deterministic engagement scoring.
- **Corporate Placements & Timed Preparation Engine:** Drive management, automated eligibility checks, question banks, timed quizzes with autosave, and readiness benchmarking.
- **Lost & Found Community Board:** Multi-factor algorithmic matching, proof-of-ownership claims, anti-self-approval enforcement, and physical handover chain-of-custody.
- **Smart Notification Feed:** Cross-module event triggers, unread counters, notification preferences, and dynamic action buttons.
- **Executive Analytics & Cross-Module Intelligence:** 10 master KPI cards, at-risk rosters, period utilization heatmaps, and RFC 4180 CSV exports.
- **Exam Management, Gradebook & Official Transcripts:** Complete examination scheduling with conflict detection, 10-point relative/absolute grading, gradebook lockdown, revaluation petitions, and tamper-resistant academic transcripts.

```

---

## Environment Variables

Configure `.env` using `.env.example` as a template:

# Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate

# Apply migrations to database
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Seed baseline academic records
npm run seed
```

*Note: For evaluation and testing environments without a live PostgreSQL daemon, Campus Connect features resilient in-memory fallback catalogs for all services, enabling full demonstration and automated testing.*

---

## Running the Project

```bash
# Run in development mode (hot reloading)
npm run dev

# Run Vitest test suite
npm run test

# Run strict TypeScript validation
npm run type-check
```

---

## Production Build

```bash
# Compile optimized production bundle
npm run build

# Launch production server on port 3000
npm run start
```

---

## Vercel Deployment

Campus Connect is pre-configured for zero-configuration deployment on Vercel:

1. **Push Repository to GitHub / GitLab:** Ensure all changes are pushed to your remote repository.
2. **Import Project into Vercel:** Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/new) and select the Campus Connect repository.
3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Add `DATABASE_URL` (pointing to Vercel Postgres, Neon, or Supabase).
   - Add `JWT_SECRET` (secure random string).
   - Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (your production Vercel URL, e.g., `https://campusconnect.vercel.app`).
4. **Deploy:** Click **Deploy**. Vercel will run `prisma generate && next build` automatically.
5. **Run Migrations on Production Database:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

---

## Known Limitations

- **Email SMTP Delivery:** Notifications and announcement triggers currently populate the in-app notification center and real-time smart feed; live external SMTP dispatch requires configuring institutional SendGrid or AWS SES credentials.
- **External CDN Drivers in Air-Gapped / Isolated Envs:** Certain headless browser automation binaries (e.g., Playwright win32 zip) encounter CDN blocks in restricted sandbox environments; full regression testing is completed via Vitest and the live HTTP assertion harness.

---

## Future Scope

- **Biometric / RFID Hardware Integration:** Direct physical turnstile and laboratory scanner integration via WebSockets for instantaneous physical attendance logging.
- **Mobile Native Application:** React Native / Expo companion app utilizing the existing secure REST API endpoints.
- **Institutional Single Sign-On (SSO):** SAML 2.0 / OAuth2 integration with Google Workspace for Education and Microsoft Azure Active Directory.
- **Automated Fee Reconciliation:** Secure institutional fee and fine settlement gateway integration.
