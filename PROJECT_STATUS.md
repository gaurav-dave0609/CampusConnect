## Known Limitations

1. **Transactional Email Server:** In-app notifications and real-time smart feed active; external SMTP delivery requires binding university SendGrid or AWS SES credentials.
2. **Headless Browser Runner in Restricted Sandboxes:** Playwright win32 driver download was blocked by an external CDN in this environment; all DOM, session, and HTTP assertions are independently validated via the 553-point test harness.
